# Natural-Selection-Simulation
## Leo Guagenti - 5/22/19
This is a basic simulation of how natural selection works in real life.<br>
Using simple variables that may mutate such as view distance, speed, view twitch, and some others, I was able to create an environment that favors 'organisims' with more favorable traits for the environment.<br>
The demo for the simulation can be found here --> https://leoguagenti.github.io/Natural-Selection-Simulation/
